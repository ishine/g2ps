# LanguageNet Grapheme-to-Phoneme Transducers

## Usage

* Download and install
[Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus)

* Get your own copy of the G2Ps: `git clone https://github.com/uiuc-sst/g2ps`

* Test the installation: `phonetisaurus-g2pfst --model=g2ps/models/akan.fst --word=ahyiakwa`
You should see the answer "ahyiakwa	21.7336	a ç i a ɥ a˥".

## Description

* The column "FSTs" is a trained grapheme-to-phoneme transducer for
use with phonetisaurus.  If the available lexicons were large enough
to test the phone error rate (PER), then it is listed in parentheses.
As of this writing, PERs range from 7\% to 45\%.  Note: some of the
trained models exceed github's file size limit, so they're not available
on the github page; instead, you can find them at
[http://speechtechnology.web.illinois.edu/data/g2ps/](http://speechtechnology.web.illinois.edu/data/g2ps/)
Currently those are (american-english, arabic, dutch, french, german,
portuguese, russian, spanish, turkish).

* The column "Pronlexes" lists pronunciation lexicons distributed on
this site; most are just short symbol tables, but a few are longer.

* Other columns are just pointers to sources.

## Acknowledgments

This project was funded from 2016-2019 as part of the
[LanguageNet](http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/research/darpa2015/index.html).
Phonetisaurus G2Ps were trained using the lexicons listed here, and
the lexicons in the LanguageNet.  Some languages had other sources:
[Appen BABEL](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/babel)
lexicons (amharic, assamese, bengali, cebuano, georgian, guarani,
haitian, igbo, javanese, kurdish, lao, lithuanian, luo, mongolian,
pushto, swahili, tagalog, tamil, tok-pisin, turkish, vietnamese, yue,
zulu), [CELEX](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc96l14) (dutch,
english, german), CALLHOME
([egyptian-arabic](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99L22),
[mandarin](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96L15),
